 Most blockchain protocols prescribe that multiple agents run costly block verification. If agents are selfish, they may rely on others to complete the verification, causing a potential failure of the blockchain. This is known as the Verifierâ€™s dilemma. We study it in a classical quorum-based consensus protocol with three types of agents: (B) the Byzantine, who can deviate arbitrarily from the protocol, (A) the Altruistic, who automatically follow the protocol, and (S) the Selfish, who maximize their payoff. We introduce a novel BAS-robust equilibrium notion and show that: (i) the honest behavior is not a BAS-robust equilibrium; (ii) all BAS-robust equilibria cause blockchain failure; and (iii) a recently proposed correlated equilibrium solution to the Verifier's dilemma is not BAS-robust. Finally, we design a quorum-based mechanism where following the protocol is BAS-robust and optimal in the sense of [Ittai Abraham et al., 2011, Distributed computing meets game theory: Combining insights from two fields].
