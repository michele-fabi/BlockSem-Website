 This paper offers a model of blockchain governance based on a virtually efficient mechanism. Agents' preference reports and betting on the reports made in the future determine the welfare maximizing allocation. To induce truth telling, the mechanism implements two part transfers with a VCG component and a betting reward that depends on how accurately the prior updated upon the agent's report predicts reports observed in the next period. The mechanism satisfies participation constraints and generates no deficit after any reported history.
