 We model the dynamic competition among national fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, andCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), whereby countries strategically digitize theircurrency and launch CBDC in response to competition from emerging cryptocurrencies and other currencies. Countries with strong but non-dominant currencies benefit themost from launching CBDC early on. The country with the strongest currency hasrelatively high incentives to digitize its currency so as to nip cryptocurrency growth in the bud and to counteract competitorsâ€™ CBDCs. We also study the role of stablecoins incurrency competition, as well as the effects of currency competition and cryptocurrencies on financial innovation. Our findings help rationalize recent developments in currency and payment digitization, while providing insights into the battle of currencies and the future of money.
