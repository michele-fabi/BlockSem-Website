 An escalation of illegal activities and the goal of improving the network’s resilience to cyber-attacks have led researchers and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) to investigate how to reduce anonymity within the Bitcoin blockchain network. Anonymity can be decreased through Bitcoin entity classification, which aims to detect and classify entities’ behavioural patterns within the network. However, this classification problem - typically addressed via supervised machine learning approaches - strongly depends on the initial labelled Bitcoin dataset, which allows the definition of singular entity behaviour. Existing approaches for addressing the class imbalance problem can be improved considering generative adversarial networks (GANs) that can boost data diversity. However, despite their potential, it is impossible to find a unique GAN solution that works for every scenario. Therefore, one aim of this investigation is to study which type of GAN architecture can be used to generate synthetic Bitcoin behaviour, which architecture generates the most “valuable” information, and how the training time affects classification results.
