 The most famous Blockchain, Bitcoin, uses Proof-of-work to elect the next block. Proof-of-work is originally a puzzle-based anti-spam technique that is used to prove that some time has passed. Another puzzle-based anti-spam method called « network guided tour » has the same purpose but do not require the client to use its computational power. In this presentation, I will explain how this method can be adapted in the context of Blockchains to replace the Proof-of-work, in order to obtain a Blockchain protocol that does not consume an amount of electricity equivalent to a small country.
